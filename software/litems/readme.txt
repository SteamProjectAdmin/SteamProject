Software/litems. Readme.

This directory stores software/firmware developments addressed to manage layout items. The directory organizes its information in a directory structure with these levels:

  1.- A first level based on the litem network technology (dcc, 802.15.4, ble, zigbee, wifi, ...)
  2.- A second level based on the litem hardware, whenever that feature determined different software developments.

Note that, since litems are able to support multiple profiles, ie, a litem can perform not one but several actions and/or collect different types of data, it is not possible to create a third level dividing litems based on their behaviors.
