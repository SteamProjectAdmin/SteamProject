Software/litems/802.11.4/ti-cc26x2-lp/elbert. Readme.

This directory stores the (Mount) Elbert Steam litems software project, a set of developments addressed to implement experimental litems running on the Texas Instruments CC26x2 Launchpad and using 802.11.4 as communication technology. Its main features are:

  - Source code developed in C running on TIRTOS (Texas Instruments RealTime Operating System) operating system
  - IEEE 802.11.4 for connecting to the gateway
  - Different profiles developed
  - Fully experimental

The project contents are organized in a first directories level based on the litem profile. Each of these directories will be similar from a structure point of view, containing these subdirectories:

  - src: stores source code
  - cfg: stores devices configurations
  - doc: stores specific project documents not present in the repository wiki
