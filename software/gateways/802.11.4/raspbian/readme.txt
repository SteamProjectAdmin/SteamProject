Software/concentrators/802.11.4/raspbian. Readme.

This directory stores software developments addressed to manage concentrators running on Raspbian operating system whose underlying network technology was based on IEEE 802.11.4.

This directory organizes its information in subdirectories whose name is the specific software development subproject. That means that different software solutions for concentrators based on raspbian and 802.11.4 can coexist, whatever were their differences in software technology or features.

In order to provide certain coherence in naming, using the names of rivers for projects in this branch is proposed.
