# Contributing to STEAM project #

Dear contributor, thanks for dedicating efforts to the STEAM project. In order to help all the contributors in their tasks, some guidelines are defined:

* In you have not read the [README](README.md) file yet, now it is a good time to get a basic overview of the project.
* Far from that basic information, the repository [wiki](../../wiki) contains all the project documentation, inlcuding background, requirements, interfaces and protocols. You must be contributor for editing entries while reading is public.
* For becoming project contributor, you will need a GitHub user account. After signing up, ask the project [administrator](mailto:steamproject.adm@gmail.com) to give your account contribution permissions on the STEAM project.
* Is highliy recommendable that you created a new project branch for developing your contribution. As the project defines several parallel tasks, is is easy bounding each task to a single-contributor branch.
* Every project directory contains a readme.txt file explaining what is expected to find in it. It is very important following the guidelines defined in these files, since among other explain how the new projects must be named.
* The project [blog](https://steam-project.blogspot.com) tracks its progresses. It is a good practice documenting there some of the tasks details, that can be helful for others or even for the own contributor (brain memory tends to erase). In order to contribute to the blog you will need a google account. Once signed up, ask the project [administrator](mailto:steamproject.adm@gmail.com) to give your account edition permissions on the blog. 
* In case you did not feel confortable writing blogs, send feedback of your progresses to the project [administrator](mailto:steamproject.adm@gmail.com) to help him to publish that information in the blog.

Again, thanks so much for your contribution.
