# STEAM: Open Scale Model System Automation

## What is STEAM?
STEAM is an open source project addressed to design and develop architectures, protocols, software and hardware for automating (control and monitor) scale model systems, as trains can be, but not limited to them.

## Wait, it already exists. Why to reinvent the wheel?
In terms of digital automation, systems as DCC (based on power line communication) were fantastic twenty years ago. Since then different radio communication technologies have been developed, allowing scale model digital automation going one step ahead. Though some emerging solutions have arised in the last times (as Roco-Fleischmann z21), most are brand property, ie not open, therefore evolving against the usual current of going "open" that you can find in hardware and software. That is the reason why STEAM makes sense.

## Sound interesting. Where can I find more information?
There are two main information sources: One is the GitHub repository wiki (right [here](https://github.com/SteamProjectAdmin/SteamProject/wiki)) and the other is the project's [blog ](https://steam-project.blogspot.com/). The wiki contains the official documentation whereas the blog contains (big surprise) the project bitacore.

## This is the Holy Grail I've been searching for years. How can I participate?
If you are good in hardware electronics or firmware/software develpment and have free time for participating on this project, contact the project [administrator](mailto:) to become project contributor. Welcome!!!
